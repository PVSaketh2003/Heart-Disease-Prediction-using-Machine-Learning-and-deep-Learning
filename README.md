🩺 **<h1> Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning & Deep Learning </h1>**

This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease using multiple machine learning and deep learning models on a structured clinical dataset.

🚀 Overview

**Dataset:** 1025 records, 14 features

**Goal:** Predict heart disease presence (1) or absence (0)

**Tools:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Keras, Matplotlib, Seaborn

⚙️ Process

**Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned data, handled outliers, and scaled features.

**EDA:** Visualized relationships between features like chest pain type, cholesterol, and thalassemia.

**Model Training:** Compared Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, KNN, and Naive Bayes.

**Hyperparameter Tuning:** Used RandomizedSearchCV for model optimization.

**Deep Learning:** Built a multi-layer ANN using Keras for binary classification.

🧠 Best Results

**KNN:** 100% accuracy

**Random Forest & Decision Tree:** ~98.5%

**ANN(Keras)**:~95.7% validation accuracy

📊 Metrics
